Data comes from:

"Using Semantic Unification to Generate Regular Expressions from Natural Language",
Nate Kushman and Regina Barilzay
NAACL 2013

We use the train/test split from lib/data/overnight within the semparse,
and then further split train into 100 dev examples and a smaller train set.

The original paper evaluated on 3-fold cross validation.
